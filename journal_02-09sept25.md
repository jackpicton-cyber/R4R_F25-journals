### Rose
-One item I enjoyed discussing amongst the cohort today was the different approach to data types.
### Thorn
-One item that I encountered that I wish had gone better was our topics remaining focused, keeping side conversations for our group breakout.
### Bud
I am looking forward to discussing our individual research topics in the breakout.
