## Rose, Bud, Thorn

> **Due Monday 8th, 11pm**

### Rose

A rose that I had from this past week's meeting was the breakout discussions I had with members from different colleges, as their opinions provided unique insights on my research.

### Thorn

A thorn that I encountered was that I felt the direction of the conversations during our meetings often fell off-track, increasing the time it took to go over material.

### Bud

Something I am looking forward to is attending the next outside-of-seminar group meetup, as I am out of town this week.
